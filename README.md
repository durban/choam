# CHOAM

*Experiments with composable lock-free concurrency*

## Overview

The type [`Rxn[-A, +B]`](core/shared/src/main/scala/dev/tauri/choam/Rxn.scala)
is similar to an effectful function from `A` to `B` (that is, `A â‡’ F[B]`), but:

- The only effect it can perform is lock-free updates to
  [`Ref`s](core/shared/src/main/scala/dev/tauri/choam/Ref.scala)
  (mutable memory locations with a pure API).
  - For example, if `x` is a `Ref[Int]`, then `x.update(_ + 1)` is a `Rxn` which
    (when executed) will increment its value.
- Multiple `Rxn`s can be composed (by using various combinators),
  and the resulting `Rxn` will *update all affected memory locations atomically*.
  - For example, if `y` is also a `Ref[Int]`, then `x.update(_ + 1) >>> y.update(_ + 1)`
    will increment both of them atomically.
- However, conflicting `Rxn`s cannot be composed. That is, `Rxn`s which
  update the same `Ref` are not allowed to be composed.
  - Currently composing conflicting `Rxn`s causes a runtime error.
  - *Future work:* either detecting this error during compile time,
    or somehow allowing conflicting updates.

## Modules

    [`Ref`](core/shared/src/main/scala/dev/tauri/choam/Ref.scala)
  - integration with synchronous effect types in
    [Cats Effect](https://github.com/typelevel/cats-effect)
- [`choam-data`](data/shared/src/main/scala/dev/tauri/choam/data/):
  data structures, like queues and stacks
- [`choam-async`](async/shared/src/main/scala/dev/tauri/choam/async/):
  - async data structures
  - integration with asynchronous effect types in
    [Cats Effect](https://github.com/typelevel/cats-effect)

## Related work

- Our `Rxn` is a lock-free, referentially transparent and extended version of
  *reagents*, described in [Reagents: Expressing and Composing Fine-grained Concurrency
  ](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~turon/reagents.pdf). (Other implementations or reagents:
  [Scala](https://github.com/aturon/ChemistrySet),
  [OCaml](https://github.com/ocamllabs/reagents),
  [Racket](https://github.com/aturon/Caper).)
- Multi-word compare-and-swap (MCAS/*k*-CAS) implementations:
  - [A Practical Multi-Word Compare-and-Swap Operation](
    https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/papers/2002-casn.pdf) (an earlier version used this
    algorithm)
  - [Efficient Multi-word Compare and Swap](
    https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.02527.pdf) (`MCAS.EMCAS` implements a variant of this algorithm)
  - A simple, non-lock-free algorithm from the Reagents paper (see above) is implemented as
    `MCAS.SpinLockMCAS`
- Software transactional memory (STM)
  - A `Rxn` is somewhat similar to a memory transaction, but there are
    important differences:
    - A `Rxn` can only touch one `Ref` at most once (see above); an STM
      transaction can usually read/write multiple times.
    - A `Rxn` is lock-free by construction (unless an `unsafe` combinator
      was used); STM transactions are not necessarily (e.g., STM "retry").
    - As a consequence of the previous point, `Rxn` cannot be used to implement
      "inherently not lock-free" logic (e.g., asynchronously waiting on a
      condition set by another thread/fiber/similar). However, `Rxn` is
      interoperable with async data types which implement
      [Cats Effect](https://github.com/typelevel/cats-effect) typeclasses.
      This feature can be used to provide such "waiting" functionality
      (e.g., `AsyncQueue.ringBuffer` is a queue with `enqueue` in `Rxn` and `deque` in `IO`).
    - STM transactions usually have a way of raising/handling errors
      (e.g., `MonadError`); `Rxn` has no such feature (of course return
      values can encode errors with `Option`, `Either`, or similar).
  - Similarities between `Rxn`s and STM transactions include the following:
    - atomicity, consistency, isolation (TODO: explain that there are some differences)
  - Some STM implementations:
    - Haskell `Control.Concurrent.STM`
    - Scala: `scala-stm`, `cats-stm`, `ZSTM`
    - TODO: TL2, SwissTM
