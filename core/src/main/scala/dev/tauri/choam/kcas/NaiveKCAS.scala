/**
 * NaÃ¯ve k-CAS algorithm as described in [Reagents: Expressing and Composing
 * Fine-grained Concurrency](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~turon/reagents.pdf)
 * by Aaron Turon; originally implemented at [aturon/ChemistrySet](
 * https://github.com/aturon/ChemistrySet).
 *
 * While this is logically correct, it basically implements
 * a spinlock for each `Ref`. Thus, it is not lock-free.
 *
 * Implemented as a baseline for benchmarking and correctness tests.
